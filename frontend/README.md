## Current Issue: HTML -> JS -> PHP -> SQL
- Write now the JS can get variables from HTML forms (note: right now the form is structured such that the first input is an email and the second is a password, which potentially could be an issue)
- We can also do PHP to SQL with hardcoded values, proving that the PHP file works apart from getting the JS username and password
- Current strategy that is not working: ajax (when you go into console view in the browser it seems that the ajax code is not running from the JS, however if you manually type it in, it runs (but still doesn't work))
- Other note: When you look at "source" in the browser it sometimes shows an older version of the JS code. I do not know why
